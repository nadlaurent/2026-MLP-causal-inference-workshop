# impact-eval-causal-inference-template

A reproducible starter repository for **impact evaluation / causal inference** projects with:

- design-first analysis driven by a 10-step canonical workflow
- strong project hygiene for assumptions, diagnostics, and reporting
- a data pipeline layout that separates raw / interim / processed data
- VS Code + GitHub Copilot custom agents and prompts tailored to causal work

This template is intentionally opinionated. It assumes:

1. you want **design-first** analysis rather than "run models until something works"
2. you care about **identification assumptions**, not just effect estimates
3. you want artifacts that survive handoff to collaborators, reviewers, or your future self

## How to use this repo

### 1. Fill in configs/project.yaml

This is your **single source of truth**. Before invoking any agent, describe your project here:
- what the intervention is and how it was assigned
- who was treated and who was not
- what outcomes you care about and when they are measured
- what pre-treatment covariates you have
- where your raw data files live

The agents read this file first and will not re-ask questions already answered here.

### 2. Drop raw data into data/raw/

Place your source data files in `data/raw/` and register their paths under `raw_data_files` in `project.yaml`.
These files are **immutable** — never edit them. All transformations go into scripts.

### 3. Ask the Planner to read project.yaml and prepare a plan

Open Copilot Chat, switch to the **Planner** agent, and say:

> "Read configs/project.yaml and prepare a causal estimation plan."

The Planner will:
- Read `project.yaml` for everything already known.
- Formulate the causal question and estimand.
- Run structural EDA on your raw data to check positivity and eligibility.
- Emulate a target trial (for observational data).
- Draw a DAG and confirm it with you.
- Output an identification block (strategy, assumptions, identification status).
- Choose an estimator matched to the identified problem.
- Ask clarifying questions via the VS Code `askQuestions` interface for any design-critical unknowns not covered by `project.yaml`. **Answer these before proceeding.**
- Write the approved plan to `docs/plans/<slug>.md` and design decisions to `docs/plans/<slug>-design.yaml`.

### 4. Hand off to the Implementer

Once the plan is approved, switch to the **Implementer** agent and say:

> "Implement the plan in docs/plans/<slug>.md."

The Implementer will run an environment check, then implement in order: data preparation,
estimation, diagnostics, refutation, and reporting. If any diagnostic guardrail fails it stops
and surfaces the failure — no summary artifact is emitted until the issues are resolved.

### 5. Route to the Reviewer

Switch to the **Reviewer** agent. It checks both the design and the implementation, classifies
every finding as design-level (back to Planner) or code-level (back to Implementer), and emits
a routing block. Iterate until the Reviewer emits `terminal: true`. Then ask the Reviewer to use 
all relevant files and artifacts to create a Word document describing the methodology and results of the analysis.

### Optional: use the Orchestrator as a single entry point

Use the **Impact Eval Orchestrator** agent instead of addressing Planner / Implementer / Reviewer
directly. The Orchestrator reads `project.yaml`, checks what already exists in `docs/plans/`,
and routes to the right agent at each stage.

## Hard stops the agents enforce

| Condition | Blocks |
|---|---|
| No DAG or DAG-equivalent argument | Identification step |
| Identification status not "identified" | Estimation |
| Structural positivity violation unresolved | Estimation |
| Environment check not passed | Estimation |
| Diagnostic guardrail breached | Reporting |

---

## Conventions

- Never edit files in `data/raw/`.
- All design decisions are saved before any estimation code is written.
- Robustness checks are first-class deliverables, not afterthoughts.
- Every table and figure is reproducible from code.
- All output artifacts record the plan version they were produced against.
