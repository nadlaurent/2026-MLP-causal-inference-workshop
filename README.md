# No Experiment, No Problem? Causal Inference in Applied Quasi-Experimental Settings

A hands-on course on estimating causal treatment effects from observational HR data in quasi-experimental setting.

## What You'll Learn

This course walks through a real-world people analytics use case: **evaluating whether a manager training program causally improves leadership outcomes and team retention.** You'll learn to:

- Estimate **Average Treatment Effects (ATE)** and **Average Treatment Effects on the Treated (ATT)** from observational data
- Build and diagnose **inverse probability of treatment weights** (stabilized, trimmed)
- Fit **IPTW-weighted outcome models with covariate adjustment** using GEE with cluster-robust standard errors
- Summarize retention using **RMST and IPTW-weighted survival differences** alongside time-varying hazard ratios
- Compare primary estimates against a **cluster-robust DoubleML** ATE robustness check
- Assess covariate balance before and after weighting
- Conduct **E-value sensitivity analyses** to evaluate robustness to unmeasured confounding
- Interpret and communicate causal findings to technical and non-technical audiences
- Understand when and why ATE vs. ATT estimands differ
---

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with regression concepts (OLS, logistic regression)
- Basic understanding of causal inference concepts (confounding, selection bias) is helpful but not required — the course materials cover these
- Working knowledge of Python (pandas, numpy) or similar language (R) also helpful but not required
